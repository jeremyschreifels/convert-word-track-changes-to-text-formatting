# VBA Code for Formatting Track Changes in Microsoft Word
## Overview
This VBA macro is designed to enhance the readability of tracked changes in Microsoft Word documents. It converts the standard track changes text into visually distinct formatted text, making it easier to identify edits. It also eliminates metadata about the additions and deletions. Deleted characters are displayed with strikethrough and colored text, while added characters are shown with underlined and colored text. This functionality is particularly useful for collaborative documents where multiple revisions can make it challenging to follow changes or when metadata, such as editor's name, attached to the edits is sensitive.

## Why This is Useful
When working on documents with multiple contributors, the default track changes feature can become cluttered and difficult to interpret. By applying this macro, users can quickly visualize the changes made by different authors, improving clarity and facilitating better collaboration. The color coding and formatting help to distinguish between additions and deletions, allowing for a more efficient review process.

## What the Code Accomplishes
The HighlightChanges macro performs the following tasks:
1. Temporarily Disables Track Changes: It saves the current state of the track changes feature and turns it off to apply formatting.
2. Loops Through Revisions: It iterates through all revisions in the document.
  A. For Deletions: It highlights deleted text with a grey background and formats text as strikethrough.
  B. For Additions: It highlights added text with a yellow background and formats text as underlined.
3. Restores Track Changes State: After formatting, it restores the original state of the track changes feature.
